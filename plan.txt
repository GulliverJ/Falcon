Falcon 9 Plan
-------------

Gameplay:
 - Two options for starting position:
	> Stage detatch
	> Landing
 - Two options for landing
	> Land
	> Barge

Very minimalist design
 - Left and right control little thingies at the top
 - Rotational velocity indicator?
 - Fuel level indication
 - 'Up' to fire thruster
 - Key to extend legs

 - Zooms in as you're landing
 - Maybe scrollwheel for thrust? That'd be better
	> Left click for left thrust, right for right
	> Middle mouse for legs

 - Have a hover button?
